      <p>
        Although there isn’t universal agreement on the question of what
        qualifies as a “country,” it is generally accepted that in order to be a
        country, a state must be a sovereign unit that has a permanent
        population, defined territorial boundaries, a government, and the
        ability to enter into agreements with other states. Even when these
        conditions are met, however, internationally recognized independence is
        not a given, and a territorial entity that declares itself to be an
        independent country is not always recognized as such by the rest of the
        world. <br />
        <br />
        We make it easy to see all the important information for each country at
        a glance, as well as flag information and an atlas overview for whatever
        area you are most curious about.
